# How to declare variables and perform basic arithmatic operations

# Declaring variables
a = 30
b = 5

# Addition
c = a+b
print("Addition is -", c)

# Subtraction
d = a-b
print("Subtraction is -", d)

# Multiplication
e = a*b
print("Multiplication is -", e)

# Division
f = a/b
print("Division is -", f)

# Floor-Division - returns the value as integer without decimal points
g = a//b
print("Floor Division is -", g)

# Modulus operator - It gives the value of reminder
f = a % b
print("Remainder of the division is -", f)

# Exponent - considers num2 as exponent of num1
num1, num2 = 5, 2
exp = num1**num2
print("Exponent function is -", exp)
