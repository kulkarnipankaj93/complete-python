Environment creation steps

What is pip?
# pip is package manager for python packages
# From python version 3.4 onwards pip is comes preinstalled with python
# To know version of pip installed on machine command - pip --version
# To install third party libraries command - pip install numpy
# Now to use newly installed library simply import that into python module
# To get list of all libraries installed command - pip list


What is virtual Environment?
# A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated Python virtual environments for them.
# simply we create different environments for different projects and store all the required libraries with different version in to that particular environment

How to create environment(for windows)?
# Open command prompt --> go to required location --> run command python -m venv env1(environment name)
# Once environment is created it creates folder with environment name which has few default folders
# To list down those folders enter environment name folder and run command --> dir
# Default folders are - Include,lib, Scripts, pyvenv.cfg
# To use this environment we need to activate that environment
# We need to run file activate.bat which is present in Scripts folder
# Go to environment folder (by using cd command) and run command --> Scripts\activate.bat
# Now as the environment is activated we can simply install required libraries with required versions in to the env
# Command to install libraries - pip install numpy==2.3(library name with version)
# Newly installed libraries are installed at following path --> env1 -> lib -> site-packages -> numpy
# To list down all libraries present in environment run command --> pip list
# To deactivate the environment simply run command - deactivate


What is requirement.txt?
# Requirement.txt is basically a text file which contains list of all the libraries with their versions
# Required for our project
# Now we can simply run this file using following command so that it will install all libraries at once
# And we will not be required to install each library separately
# Command to run -> pip install -r requirement.txt(file name)
